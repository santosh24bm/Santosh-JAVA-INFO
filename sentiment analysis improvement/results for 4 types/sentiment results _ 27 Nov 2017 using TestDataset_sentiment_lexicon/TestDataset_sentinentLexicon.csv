It use to work just fine.
Not user friendly.
Soon as hubby needs a new phone we will say bye bye to att.
 Even a 5 year old can make a better app.
This may be the end of our years-long relationship.
9Wish i could rate it Zero ??????
not bad 
Get rid of the CrApple ads.
t's been going on for a while and I'm sick of calling.
Irritating!!
I hate this app it's the worst of the worst.
Without a doubt the worst app I have ever used which explains a lot because it came from the worst company I have ever had to do business with...
I'm going too see if I can file a report too them about these issues.
This app is hands down the worst thing I've ever used.
Super disappointing app from such a good cell provider.
10302This new app is not user friendly.user experience1 selected 1
10095You claim to be the best but the reality is different...
Very dissatisfied!
I am not satisfactory
Wastage of time!
Cant use it internationally !
stupid app
Never gonna uss indigo
Very Bad 
They fooled us to show much costly airfare
Even bookings earlier showing disappeared. 
What an idiotic app... 
So
this mobile app is atrocious. How the hell did it pass scrutiny?
t's just a waste of time and phone memory installing and using this app.
I am very irritated.
Practically not usable.
Not working well
it sucks
terrible
what the hell
pathetic
hate it
horrible service
many issue 
login has issues
trouble logging in 
cheaters
minus ratings
fix this problem 
Wish I could give it negative rating of -10
what a joke 
rediculous service
Used to be good
Does the job
Does what you want.
totally ineffective
 BAjet is racing to the bottom !
Used to work perfectly.
without perfection
idiotic app 
shameful for the company 
hey cancelled my booking without any information & they refunded my money after deducting insurance.
I will never choose go air again..
Complete wastage of time.
Look like fake app.
Really money minded people..
he app looks like hacked together by a couple of students using assets drawn in Paint
It allows me to get cheap airline tickets
 Not at all helpful for users.
 You people have made a joke of your application. 
still no luck 
 It is strongly recommended to not book through go air as god knows when your flight will be non operational
Don't book early in goair flight because they can cancel the flight at any time without any reason.
Go Air must explain/apologise/compensate for such fraudulent and unethical business practice
wake up guys 
 The ground staff thinks that we are fool.
Rating in negative.
Mobile app is classic..
dont deserve any rating
would rate 0
This app is too good without errors
 Or success has gone into your head...
I wish I could give one star.
app is broken
The app is neat and works fine
The airline is great
Used to be very handy
